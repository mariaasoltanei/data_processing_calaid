-every 20 seconds, the data from the accelerometer sensor and from the gyroscope sensor is sent to database
-every 5 minutes, the apps makes a request to the server 
-the server takes the acc and gyro data from the last five minutes and sends the activity name to the app. 
    since the accuracy is low + the server will send a list of activities, the frequency of the activity in 
    that list will be chosen
-inside the app there will be an if else according to compendium that will decide METS -sau inside the server
-then, calories will be added like this: 1.05* METS * duration(hour)-5 mins * weight of user
